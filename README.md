# Statistical_analysis
 The purpose of this project was to determine the tariff plan of the company "Allo, privet",  which brings the greatest revenue. During the statistical analysis of the data, it was found  out that the average value of user revenue for the "Ultra" and "Smart" tariffs differ.  The average monthly revenue per user for the "Ultra" tariff was 1,142 rubles, and for the "Smart" tariff 682 rubles.  The average value of user revenue in Moscow and other cities does not differ.  During 2018, both tariffs saw an increase in the number of minutes of conversation,  the number of messages and Internet traffic. In 2018, 38 people abandoned their tariff.  The number of users who use the "Smart" tariff was 351 people, and "Ultra" 149 people.  The largest profit is brought by the "Ultra" tariff of 1142 rubles per month per user.
